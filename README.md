### Building my first pipelin
- I came across airflow and got interested to learn about it. I navigated and found some useful resources from datacamp and decided why not!
- i got stuck for a week and decided to try on my own. I decided to try this project before finding it again in same datacamp haha!
- Astro dev is a good tool to dev it resembles vite where everything is simplified for you.

  ## Project Aspect
  - This project I would describle it simply as web scrapping where data is extracted from Polygon API then transformed and loaded to the pipeline.
